### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before we can accept your pull request, we need you to sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

**Why a CLA?**

The CLA is a standard practice in many large open-source projects. It helps us protect both you as a contributor and Turnersoft Co., Limited as the project steward. The agreement clarifies the intellectual property rights for your contributions, ensuring that we have the necessary rights to incorporate your work into the project and to license it to our commercial customers. This dual-licensing model allows us to maintain the project and continue to provide a high-quality open-source tool.

**How to Sign**

We use a CLA management tool to make this process as simple as possible. When you open your first pull request, a bot will comment with a link to the CLA. You will need to follow the link and electronically sign the agreement. This is a one-time process for all your contributions to Turn-Formal.

We are excited to see your contributions!
