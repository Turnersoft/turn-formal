Turn-Formal is a new approach to formal mathematics and verification, built in Rust. This paper introduces the Turn-Formal library, its architecture, and its advantages over existing systems. We discuss the motivation behind high-level formal systems, demonstrate how Turn-Formal makes verification accessible to developers, and outline our roadmap for future development. Turn-Formal aims to bridge the gap between rigorous mathematical proof and practical software development, providing an expressive yet powerful framework for formal verification.

Turn-Formal's API is designed to be intuitive and chainable:

#block(
  width: 100%,
  inset: 0.5em,
  fill: turn-blue.lighten(95%),
  radius: 0.5em,
  [

)

The architecture of Turn-Formal follows a layered approach:

#figure(
  rect(width: 100%, height: 8cm, stroke: none, fill: none)[
    #align(center)[
      #table(
        columns: (1fr),

        fill: (col, row) => if row == 3 { turn-blue.lighten(90%) } else { white },

#heading[Creating Theorems with Turn-Formal]

Turn-Formal makes it easy to express and prove theorems in various mathematical domains. Below is an example of proving a theorem in group theory:

#block(
  width: 100%,
  inset: 0.5em,
  fill: turn-blue.lighten(95%),
  radius: 0.5em,
  [
    *Example: Proving a theorem about group inverses*
    
    #theorem-example
  ]
)

This example demonstrates how Turn-Formal enables developers to express mathematical concepts directly in Rust, with a clear and readable syntax that closely mirrors mathematical notation while maintaining the full power of formal verification.

#heading[Conclusion]

Turn-Formal represents a significant step forward in making formal verification accessible and practical for software developers. By combining the rigor of formal methods with the power and ergonomics of Rust, Turn-Formal bridges the gap between mathematical proof and software development.

The key innovations of Turn-Formal include:

- A developer-friendly API that makes formal verification approachable
- Strong performance characteristics for large-scale verification tasks
- Seamless integration with the Rust ecosystem and tooling
- Flexible architecture that can adapt to various domains
- Balance between human readability and machine verifiability

As we continue to develop Turn-Formal, we invite the community to join us in building a more rigorous and reliable software ecosystem, where formal verification becomes a standard part of the development process rather than a specialized niche.
