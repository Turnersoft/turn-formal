/// Numerical Analysis Theory
///
/// This module provides the mathematical foundations for numerical analysis,
/// focusing on the core concepts that underpin all numerical methods.
///
/// Key components:
///
/// 1. Function Spaces and Operators:
///    - Banach and Hilbert spaces
///    - Linear and nonlinear operators
///    - Functionals and variations
///
/// 2. Approximation Theory:
///    - Best approximation in normed spaces
///    - Interpolation and projection
///    - Error bounds and convergence rates
///
/// 3. Discretization Theory:
///    - Finite elements, differences, spectral methods
///    - Grid generation and adaptation
///    - Stability and consistency
///
/// 4. Iteration Theory:
///    - Fixed point methods
///    - Newton-like methods
///    - Convergence acceleration
///
/// 5. Error Analysis:
///    - A priori and a posteriori estimates
///    - Stability analysis
///    - Error propagation
///
/// This theory builds upon:
/// - Analysis (function spaces, derivatives)
/// - Topology (convergence, compactness)
/// - Linear Algebra (matrices, eigenvalues)
/// - Measure Theory (integration, norms)
