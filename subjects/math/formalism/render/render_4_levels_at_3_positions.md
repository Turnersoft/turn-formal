can you design the @section_node.rs  types to accomodate 4 levels of abstraction times 3 display mode (full wiki page, tooltip, reference as link). Let's think of how to distinguish with MathNode in @math_node.rs .

level 1: full wiki page acted as schema, with components and properties as children. Other L1 L2 L3 can refer to it, but L4 cannot refer to any L1 page. As a wiki page, we want to show all details but still in a math-like detail, so the variable and symbols should be in MathNode which will be rendered in correct styles as the math textbook. 
I think MathNode here only wraps contents that are particularly math-like, such as bracket and operators and special arrangement of element like matrix, category diagrams, vectors, subscripts superscripts, special characters. 
Its tooltip page is similar to wiki page but cut off the detail explanation of the wiki page, and it also has a vertical array of field to explain.

level 2: schema with field manifested compared to L1. the wilki page is L1's wiki page but with selected field highlighted. The tooltip is similar to L1 but with the selected field put at the top of the list. Now since we have specific properties and structure, the style at reference is richer than L1's. So a L1 group will just look like "... a Group..." while a L2 set will look like "...a finite symmetric Group with set of real number..." where the whole phrase of group with adjectives has a light background, and the word "finite" "symmetric", "set of real number" is not just an adjective but also have tiny arrows beside, when you click, the tooltip will show up as well as a dropdown showing all the options.

level 3: constructors method, the detail methods cannot be shown in reference mode, but we do need to have a short descriptive way of referencing it in other context. The tooltip of it needs both the construction process as well as the returning type which is in L2, so we need to put both inside the tooltip nicely. we need a layout struct in @section_node.rs (please check if we have it or not) to organize both info. When referenced it shows the name, because no other field seems appropriate to be put beside.

level 4: this is a very concrete value, it share the same structure as L1 and L2 but the components are filled with actual element examples(i say example because we can't visualize all elements for an inifinite set or very large set). When referenced, we should show a thumbnail?

There is one more mode of reference for all of these levels of objects and that is by variable, I can decalre variables and use it repeatedly, and level 4 should always be used as a variable, because the structure may be bizarre. But the problem with variable is we need to access the parts of that object we need some indexing method like A_ij for matrix, the sub/superscripts have syntactic power and we need to distinguish it with other indentifier-only scripts. But it is okay, we can merge scripts with all purposes into MathNode export for math variable.
